First HTML Project

Writing this after following the steps on TOP Project: Recipes page.

I didn't have any issues, luckily. Though I did make a mistake of not closing my ordered lists, which I found when checking the code in a html validator.

I also forgot to commit the project with git until I was about 90% done.

I'm happy with how everything went, though.
